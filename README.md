## Introduction

For today's fast-paced business environment, freelancers, small businesses, and service providers require efficient instruments for managing billing and payment processes. To this end, we recommend designing a Simple Invoice System, a built-in web-based application that can simplify the creation, sending, and following of invoices.

The system will provide users with fundamental invoicing features through a simplified interface. Users will be able to securely log in or sign up, manage their clients, create and edit invoices, and track the payment status. Compared to more advanced platforms, this app is confined to the basics of invoicing and is ideal for users who need a basic but reliable billing facility.

This project borrows ideas from open-source options like Invoice Ninja but limit the scope to keep things simple, easy to use, and efficient. The proposed system will serve as a working solution for individuals and small organizations that want to improve the accuracy of billing and save their time.

##  Objectives

- ✅ **User-Friendly Interface**  
  Provide an intuitive platform for managing invoices and payments made by clients.

- ⚙️ **Efficiency through Automation**

- 🧾 **Empower Small Organizations**  
  Equip small businesses with tools to effectively create, track, and manage invoices.

- 📚 **Centralized Records**  
  Centralize customer and payment records in one place for easy tracking and reporting.

- 🌱 **Sustainable Invoicing**  
  Promote sustainability by reducing paper usage through digital invoicing solutions.

This ERD represents the data structure of a Simple Invoice System designed for freelancers and small businesses. The system includes six main entities: User, Client, Invoice, InvoiceItem, Payment, and RecurringInvoice. Each user can manage multiple clients and generate invoices for them. Invoices can have multiple items and receive multiple payments. Recurring invoices allow users to automate billing on a schedule. The relationships are primarily one-to-many, ensuring a clear and efficient data model.
